## What we do

Rez0 Security performs Web Application Assessments, API Assessments, as well as Mobile Application Assessments. This includes a scoping call, a quote, a kick-off call, all of the testing, a report, and a debrief. Rez0 Security will hack your websites and/or applications and report all the findings to you in order to help make your company's internet presence be much more secure. 

## What we care about

Websites with any complexity are traditionally very insecure. Our vision is to help company's secure their websites in a partnership approach by attempting to use gathered expertise to find flaws, and then articulate them well so that the developers can easily fix them. 

There are many organizations such as non-profits and churches which will likely never have the budget to prioritize security testing. It has always been Rez0 Security's hope to use his skills to serve these churches and non-profit organizations. For that reason, anytime a company purchases a medium or large assessment, they are able to nominate an organizatin to receive a free small assessment.
